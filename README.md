# snake_game
Python Snake Game programmed using the pygame module. üêç

## Dependencies
Since this program depends on pygame, it must be installed using this command:
```
pip install pygame
```

## Playing the Game

The objective of the game of Snake is to control the snake to eat food, get longer, and get a higher score. The score increases by 1 every time the snake eats food. If the snake crashes into the wall or into itself it's automatically game over.

I added a feature where the game starts at level 1 and when the score reaches a multiple of 10, the user gets to the next level where the speed of the pixel increases.
