# snake_game
Python Snake Game programmed using the pygame module. üêç

## Dependencies
Since this program depends on pygame, it must be installed using this command:
```
pip install pygame
```

## Playing the Game

**IMPORTANT:** This program will not work right off the bat because on line 16 of main.py the file path for the image icon is not set.

The objective of the game of Snake is to control the snake to eat food, get longer, and get a higher score. The score increases by 1 every time the snake eats an apple. If the snake crashes into the wall or into itself it's automatically game over.

To start playing the game, click one of the arrow keys on your keyboard and use the arrow keys to control the snake.

I added a feature where the game starts at level 1 and when the score reaches a multiple of 10, the user gets to the next level where the speed of the pixel increases.
